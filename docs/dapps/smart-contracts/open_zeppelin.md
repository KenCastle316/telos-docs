# Open Zeppelin Contracts
-----                                   --------
Open Zeppelin contracts are a library for secure smart contract development, built on a solid foundation of community-vetted code.

Implementations of standards such as [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) and [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).

Flexible [role-based permissioning](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control) scheme.

Reusable [Solidity components](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/utilities) to build custom contracts and complex decentralized systems.
